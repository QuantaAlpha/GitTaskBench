# GitTaskBench
## ðŸ‘‹Overview
GitTaskBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of intelligent agents across multiple modalities and task complexities. It encompasses **54 tasks** spanning **7 key domains**.

Each domain features a curated set of tasks that reflect real-world applications and research challenges. These tasks assess an agent's ability to interpret complex instructions, process multi-modal inputs, perform reasoning, and deliver accurate, meaningful outputs.
